# Test a FastAPI App

This recipe demonstrates how to test FastAPI applications using [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/index.html).  

Testing is crucial in API development because it ensures reliability, maintainability, and confidence in your codebase.   
Using Pytest with Dependency Injection (via fixtures) provides several key benefits: it allows you to isolate components, making tests more focused and easier to debug; it enables you to mock external dependencies (like databases or third-party services) to test your API logic in isolation; and it helps maintain test consistency by reusing setup code across multiple tests.  

This approach not only catches bugs early but also makes your code more modular and easier to refactor, as changes in one component can be tested without affecting others. Additionally, well-structured tests serve as living documentation, helping new developers understand how different parts of your API are expected to work.

## Code snippets

To test our FastAPI application, we will augment the existing code structure to include the following:

| File    | Purpose |
| -------- | ------- |
| `pytest.ini`  | Pytest configuration    |
| `tests/conftest.py`  | Root Pytest behaviours (e.g. global fixtures)  |
| `tests/test_app.py`  | Test suite for main application  |
| `tests/routes/v1/test_healthcheck.py`  | Test suite for healthcheck endpoint |
| `tests/**/__init__.py`  | Dummy file to register folders as modules under respective test folders    |

```bash
tree -L 4
.
├── pytest.ini
├── tests
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── conftest.py
│   ├── routes
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   └── v1
│   │       ├── __init__.py
│   │       └── test_healthcheck.py
│   └── test_app.py
```

#### Pytest Setup

```ini title="pytest.ini"
[pytest]
testpaths = tests
python_files = test_*.py
python_functions = test_*
python_classes = Test*
addopts = -v 
```

```python title="tests/conftest.py"
import pytest
from fastapi.testclient import TestClient

from app import app

@pytest.fixture
def client():
    """Create a test client for the FastAPI application."""
    return TestClient(app)
```

#### Tests per FastAPI code

```python title="tests/test_app.py"
from fastapi import status

def test_root_endpoint(client):
    """Test the root endpoint returns the expected response."""
    response = client.get("/")
    assert response.status_code == status.HTTP_200_OK
    data = response.json()
    assert "app" in data
    assert "message" in data
    assert data["app"] == "Databricks FastAPI Example"
```

```python title="tests/routes/v1/test_healthcheck.py"
from fastapi import status

def test_healthcheck(client):
    """Test the healthcheck endpoint."""
    response = client.get("/api/v1/healthcheck")
    assert response.status_code == status.HTTP_200_OK
    data = response.json()
    assert "status" in data
    assert data["status"] == "OK"
    assert "timestamp" in data
```

## Running Tests

:::info

The tests we have included do not require the FastAPI application to be running, but we provide examples of [dependency injection](https://docs.pytest.org/en/4.6.x/fixture.html#fixtures-a-prime-example-of-dependency-injection) in the cookbook source code when not connected to a live environment.

:::


```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific tests
pytest tests/routes/v1/test_healthcheck.py

# Run with coverage report
pytest --cov=app tests/
```

## Permissions

There are no permission restrictions to run local tests.
