# Connect Local Machine to Databricks App

This recipe demonstrates how to connect from your local machine to a deployed Databricks App.

:::warning

The FastAPI application running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 does not require a [valid bearer token](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/dev-tools/auth/#databricks-authorization-methods) but only when deployed on Databricks Apps.
This token is required for accessing Databricks Apps via the secured HTTPS URL with `/api` endpoints.  

:::

## Generate OAuth2 Bearer token
The easiest method to generate a valid token is to use the [Databricks CLI](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/dev-tools/cli/tutorial) which allows you to authenticate with the workspace where the Databricks App is hosted.


Users can log into a workspace via the CLI command:
```bash
databricks auth login --host https://<databricks-workspace-url> --profile my-env
```

Upon logging in successfully via the browser, you will see that your profile has been saved. This is helpful if you need to test your app across multiple environments.
```bash
Profile my-env was successfully saved
```

A bearer token can then be generated with a limited TTL; temporarily store the `access_token` details for use later on.

```bash
databricks auth token --profile my-env
{
  "access_token": "ey....<REDACTED>",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expiry": "2025-04-14T21:11:13.933142+01:00"
}
```

## Code snippets

The following examples below show how the FastAPI application can be called using the bearer token.

#### cURL

```bash
curl -X GET "https://your-app-url/api/v1/healthcheck" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_DATABRICKS_TOKEN"
```

#### Python

```python
import requests

response = requests.get(
    "https://your-app-url/api/v1/healthcheck",
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer YOUR_DATABRICKS_TOKEN"}
)
print(response.json())
```

If you would like to avoid storing the token in your code, you can leverage the profile you have created using the Databricks CLI through the Databricks Python SDK directly.

```python
from databricks.sdk.core import Config
import requests

config = Config(profile="my-env")
token = config.oauth_token().access_token

response = requests.get(
    "https://your-app-url/api/v1/healthcheck",
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {token}"},
)
print(response.json())
```

## Permissions

For local connectivity and authentication, the connecting user(s)/group(s) needs the following permissions:

- `CAN USE` on the target app

## Dependencies

- [Databricks SDK for Python](https://pypi.org/project/databricks-sdk/) - `databricks-sdk`
- [Requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) - `requests`


```python title="requirements.txt"
databricks-sdk
requests
