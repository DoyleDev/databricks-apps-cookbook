# Create a FastAPI app

This recipe demonstrates how to create a simple [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) application that can be deployed on Databricks Apps.

## Code structure

Our FastAPI application will initially have the following structure:

| File                       | Purpose                                                            |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `app.py`                   | Main FastAPI application entrypoint                                |
| `app.yaml`                 | Databricks Apps deployment configuration                           |
| `requirements.txt`         | Main application dependencies                                      |
| `routes/__init__.py`       | Module initialisation for API-router                               |
| `routes/v1/__init__.py`    | Sub-module initialisation for API-router (e.g. `/api/v1/*` routes) |
| `routes/v1/healthcheck.py` | Isolated code handler for healthcheck                              |

```bash
tree -L 3
.
├── app.py
├── app.yaml
├── routes
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── v1
│       ├── __init__.py
│       └── healthcheck.py
├── requirements.txt
```

### Main application entrypoint

```python title="app.py"
from fastapi import FastAPI

from routes import api_router

app = FastAPI(
    title="FastAPI & Databricks Apps",
    description="A simple FastAPI application example for Databricks Apps runtime",
    version="1.0.0",
)

# Router assignment
app.include_router(api_router)
```

### API routes

:::warning

In order to use OAuth2 Bearer token authentication with Databricks Apps, your application code must provide valid routes with a prefix of `/api`.

:::

Let's define the main router entrypoint for the application.

```python title="routes/__init__.py"
from fastapi import APIRouter

# Import routers from versioned packages
from .v1 import router as v1_router

# Create a router for the API
api_router = APIRouter()

# Include versioned routers - prefix must have /api for Databricks Apps token-based auth
api_router.include_router(v1_router, prefix="/api/v1")
```

We then can define specific routers for the application, using versioning and specific endpoints for isolation per optimal practice.

Next, we can create a dedicated file to handle healthchecks, exposed via `https://<app-url>/api/v1/healthcheck`.

```python title="routes/v1/__init__.py"
"""V1 API routes."""

from fastapi import APIRouter

from .healthcheck import router as healthcheck_router

router = APIRouter()

# Include endpoint-specific routers
router.include_router(healthcheck_router)
```

```python title="routes/v1/healthcheck.py"
from datetime import datetime, timezone
from fastapi import APIRouter
from typing import Dict

router = APIRouter()

@router.get("/healthcheck")
async def healthcheck() -> Dict[str, str]:
    """Return the API status."""
    return {"status": "OK", "timestamp": datetime.now(timezone.utc).isoformat()}
```

## Running the FastAPI application

### Local machine

To run the application locally, use the following terminal command: `uvicorn app:app --reload`:

```bash
INFO:     Will watch for changes in these directories: ['/Users/user.name/home/databricks-apps-cookbook/fastapi']
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
INFO:     Started reloader process [56162] using StatReload
INFO:     Started server process [56164]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
```

Once the app is running, you will be to access the following endpoints:

- Index Page: http://127.0.0.1:8000
- OpenAPI Docs: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
- Healthcheck: http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/healthcheck

Accessing the app or making changes to `app.py` will update the tailing application log in the terminal:

```bash
INFO:     127.0.0.1:54508 - "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
INFO:     127.0.0.1:58696 - "GET /docs HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
INFO:     127.0.0.1:58696 - "GET /openapi.json HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
INFO:     127.0.0.1:58893 - "GET /api/v1/healthcheck HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
```

```bash
WARNING:  StatReload detected changes in 'app.py'. Reloading...
INFO:     Shutting down
INFO:     Waiting for application shutdown.
INFO:     Application shutdown complete.
INFO:     Finished server process [56164]
INFO:     Started server process [63412]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
```

### Databricks Apps runtime

Assuming the code works locally, you can also deploy this application to a Databricks workspace using Databaricks Apps.

Follow the [Get started with Databricks Apps](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/dev-tools/databricks-apps/get-started) for deployment instructions.

For the app [configuration](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/dev-tools/databricks-apps/configuration#configuring-your-databricks-apps-with-the-appyaml-file), use:

```yaml title="app.yaml"
command: ["uvicorn", "app:app"]
```

The [FastAPI](https://pypi.org/project/fastapi/) and [uvicorn](https://pypi.org/project/uvicorn/) packages are included in the [default Databricks Apps environment](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/dev-tools/databricks-apps/#installed-python-libraries).

For parity with your local code and to trigger Databricks Apps to install the latest package version, include a `requirements.txt` in your application folder as described in the following section.

## Dependencies

- [FastAPI](https://pypi.org/project/fastapi/) - `fastapi`
- [uvicorn](https://pypi.org/project/uvicorn/) - `uvicorn`

```python title="requirements.txt"
fastapi
uvicorn
```
