# Connect external app to Databricks App

This recipe demonstrates how to connect from your externally hosted application to an API deployed as a Databricks App.

:::info

This connectivity option is called Machine-to-Machine (M2M) and requires you to set up a Databricks [service principal](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/dev-tools/auth/oauth-m2m) as per security best practices.

:::

## Code snippet

The example below requires you to input a valid databricks workspace host URl as well as [service principal](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/dev-tools/auth/oauth-m2m) client id and client secret when instantiating the `WorkspaceClient`.

Alternatively, you can set up these values as environment variables `DATABRICKS_HOST`, `DATABRICKS_CLIENT_ID`, and `DATABRICKS_CLIENT_SECRET`. The `WorkspaceClient` will auomatically pick up these environemnt variables.

```python
from databricks.sdk import WorkspaceClient
import requests

wc = WorkspaceClient(
    host="https://<DATABRICKS_HOST>",
    client_id="<DATABRICKS_CLIENT_ID>",
    client_secret="<DATABRICKS_CLIENT_SECRET>"
)
headers = wc.config.authenticate() # Contains Bearer Token

response = requests.get(
    "https://your-app-url/api/v1/healthcheck", headers=headers
)
print(response.json())
```

## Permissions

For external app connectivity and authentication, the connecting [service principal](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/dev-tools/databricks-apps/#how-does-databricks-apps-manage-authorization) needs the following permissions:

- `CAN USE` on the target app

## Dependencies

- [Databricks SDK for Python](https://pypi.org/project/databricks-sdk/) - `databricks-sdk`
- [Requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) - `requests`

```python title="requirements.txt"
databricks-sdk
requests
```
